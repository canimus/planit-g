Once we moved past the script development challenges, test execution was completed and results were reported to stakeholders and its impact to the business.  We identified and helped fix a critical memory issue, which otherwise could have been a showstopper for the parking lot in the airport.  Happy that we could improve the quality of the solutions being implemented in the airport, which not only provided confidence to the Airport but also a good experience to the customers when they arrive at the parking lot	Tested .Net, 300u, 10+ business processes,3 scenarios,50+ transactions, 4sec ART,LR Tested Web,300u, 6 business processes,1 scenario,70 transactions,3 sec ART,LR Tested TCP,20u,6 business proceses, 2 scenarios, 10 transactions, 2 sec ART,Jmeter Tested Web, 155u, 29 business processes,2 scenarios,200 transactions,5 sec ART,LR Tested Wev, 1000u,15 business processes,1 scenario, 80 transactions, 5 sec ART,LR		Aravind Sridharan

I was a little afraid prior to starting the engagement as I was unsure if my skill and experience level was advanced enough, especially because there were no other Planit team members I'd be working with.  I went in and I felt at home immediately. The project is challenging and inspiring, and I feel blessed to have learned so much from so many people here. They've given me quite a lot of responsibility, and I am one of only two testers on an agile project.

The main challenge was to maintain continuity in creating cases and their outcomes. This was achieved by customising the current Planit framework. The automation engagement continued with the addition of various new areas in JUJP project and it extended for more than 1 year.

Being new in Planit last August 2014, it has been long since I come face to face with codes because I have been doing mostly functional testing (manual) in my last two companies. So when Meny said that I would be joining two super techie colleagues in CBH for a 4week engagement, I felt nervous that I won't be able to deliver. I thought my coding juices have all gone. I felt small with my experiences compared to those two. But they were all helpful and considerate. They were there to guide me and put me back to the coding track again.   Then came my second engagement. Meny gave me all the encouragement and support in self-learning Ruby, Watir and Selenium. I thought, it was just for some "good-to-have-skill" as a functional automation tester. Then I was called that I would have a week-long project with HBF; considering all the existing pending issues with the environment setup and available workstations for automation, I would say, that we managed to deliver the Regression pack for EBS despite aggressive time frame and schedule. We were then extended for another week to update the existing hbf_factory to fix errors and revise some parts of the framework to make it more data-driven.   Those two projects taught me that there are a LOT of things to learn in Technical Testing, and it has grown big and fast the last time I used it. Everyday, newer tools and technologies are introduced to the market so learning is never-ending. And more experienced people are always there to give their helping brains.  	None.

I helped them with creating the test automation from scratch, automated the end to end user journeys which help them in working  towards the continuous delivery.  Improved their test strategies and build the framework where they now align with rest of technology teams in sprint environment.	Used Jmeter for performance testing Location Broker for the MNO in UK and in Nigeria.	1. Created automation framework using Ruby and Capybara for Vodafone assignment. 2. Framework works on the multiple browsers and also test responsiveness of the web application. 3. Integrated the framework with the Saucelabs for testing web application using different desktop and mobile browsers. 4. Test data setup was handled in such a way that user should be able to run the test against any environment using environment specific data, instead of hard-coding data in the feature files.

Using HP QTP and HP QC, I have created a Hybrid Automation Framework which utilizes a combination of Keyword and Data-driven approaches for DBS' internal test automation team, which impressed the management upon POC and was immediately implemented to the next nominated application that was due for automation, which is a Mainframe project. After a quick implementation once the framework was ready, it was able to support 300 test cases with only 1 test script and have garnered the management's positive impression, allowing the framework to be implemented to all projects moving forward. As of now, this framework is being implemented to handle test automation for more than 15 applications built in different technologies like Mainframe, Java, Web, .Net / C++, Oracle Forms, and was even extended to support mobile testing for Android and iOS. I have also extended the usage of this test framework to integrate with UNIX as part of back-end testing of the normal GUI applications as it is very common in the bank. Post execution, the test results are automatically created. I initially wrote this to produce an HTML test result, however I have seen the possibility to adjust it to be written in Microsoft Excel since our normal day to day users would be able to appreciate this better as excel is something that they use in their daily BAU. The results, being in tabular form, enable users with options to filter specific details and lets them add desired formulas or new sheets once they have downloaded their own copies of the test results. Few other enhancements for the automation framework have been provided as well such as support for re-execution for failed test cases or those that inevitably crash mid-way execution, as well as an extensibility that helps to regenerate test results without the need to re-execute from QC/QTP and be collected as a single summary file through a separate Excel macro, which the test automation team has appreciated very much as it lets them provide test results to our stakeholders anytime.

As a sole Planit resource to deliver this performance testing, I was responsible for completing all the performance test deliverables: estimate, test plan, test scripts, interim test execution reports and test summary report. As the solution utilises the multiple existing infrastructures to support the end-to-end file delivery to the downstream systems, I have to manage each performance test execution through coordination of supporting resources across multiple teams including the vendor Computershare. Achievement: Adapt a de-couple performance test approach within short timeframe due to non-delivery of an end-to-end solution by the project within the Q3 timeframe – project is to deliver an end-to-end approach in the next Q4 release. The de-couple performance test was able to identify that the vendor cannot sustained the target hourly volume due to the lack of mechanism to control the volume on the shared infrastructure with their other clients. The business impact would be that the daily volume may not be delivered within the EOD cut-off time. This outcome provided the project stakeholders with remediation options to seek a technical solution or a change in the business process to be implemented in Q4.

It took almost a week for us to crack how the forms update the databases and work our performance scripts.

The performance test results showed that the host servers were seriously resource-constrained in the event of a failure in one of the load-balanced servers. The virtual hardware was iteratively scaled up and re-tested until performance was acceptable in the event of a server failure.       On the day of the launch, a configuration error with the load balancer caused all traffic to be sent to a single server. Performance remained acceptable and the launch was a success.
